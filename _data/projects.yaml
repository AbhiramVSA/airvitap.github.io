  description: "SimplyMime is a wholesome gesture recognition system to make life simpler. It combines the power of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) to provide a better and faster user experience in the ubiquitous environment just with the movement of the fingers. The user can control the systems in the integrated ubiquitous environment just by moving the hands in the air and making gestures just like we have seen in the movies. A lot of day-to-day activities like moving the mouse, controlling volume, drawing, opening specific applications, home automations etc., can be much simpler with our SimplyMime. SimplyMime not only makes this a reality but also follows the user around their room so that every gesture the user makes is clearly read, and the task is accomplished. The system would track the user movements and a webcam mounted on to a microcontroller would turn to the user wherever the user is in the room. The user can further make relevant gestures with their hands and the system will immediately respond. SimplyMime uses face detection, pose estimation combined with port communication to the microcontroller to achieve this. This system can be further scaled and used for various other purposes like gaming, Unmanned vehicle control (e.g.: drones) and other controls etc. "

  subtitle: IoT-Enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Detecting WildFires using Convolutional Neural Networks
  image: images/photo.jpg
  link: https://github.com/
  description: "The rise of global temperatures, over the past few decades, has disrupted the usual balance of nature. As a result of increasing temperatures, wildfires have destroyed millions of acres of land, thousands of structures, and homes. The pollution and toxic gases produced by the wildfires are carried out to thousands of miles, thus threatening the lives all around the world. Most wildfires occur due to anthropogenic factors, which cannot be predicted solely based on climate conditions. Henceforth, to detect wildfires before escalating, we propose iDrone, which is a wildfire detection system equipped with an end-to-end CNN image classification model: XtinguishNet, trained on a wildfire imagery dataset to detect the possible flames or smokes in an image. In addition, our approach also acquires the weather data and the intensity of the fire. Contrasting with existing wildfire detection systems, our proposed solution is a fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Deep Learning, aiming to provide a one-stop solution for all the needs required to minimize the damage caused by wildfires. When validated and tested using various benchmark datasets, video surveillance, iDrone acquired a high accuracy of 98.36% with the least computational power."

  description: "Voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa etc. are used widely across the globe for home automation, these require the use of special phrases also known as hotwords to wake it up and perform an action like “Hey Alexa!”, “Ok Google” and “Hey Siri” etc. These hotwords are detected with lightweight real-time engines whose purpose is to detect the hotwords uttered by the user. This research presents the design and implementation of a hotword detection engine based on one-shot learning which detects the hotword uttered by the user in real-time with just one or few training samples of the hotword. This approach is efficient when compared to existing implementations because the process of adding a new hotword in the existing systems requires enormous amounts of positive and negative training samples and the model needs to retrain for every hotword. This makes the existing implementations inefficient in terms of computation and cost. The architecture proposed in this research has achieved an accuracy of 96.8%.

  description: "The twenty first century has witnessed an enormous rise in data produced per person and it has also witnessed newer and advanced forms of digital attacks and instinctively, witnessed a rise in the need for data protection. However, the essential assets are still physical and needs to be protected. Usually vaults, lockers, safes and so on and used for the safe keeping of the physical assets. However, studies have shown they are vulnerable to various attacks. This research proposes a novel and robust physical lock for safekeeping of physical assets called Loki. A Physical Security key is used to authenticate the lock and it uses a cloud-server architecture. It employs best cloud security practices, proper use of cryptography and trusted computing to mitigate all common risks. The cloud architecture runs a Virtual Machine (VM) to securely authenticate using Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) specifications. The physical authenticator data is stored in the cloud for securityand only accessed when an unlock is requested. The cloud allows web-based physical key management for adding more keys or removing keys. The whole system has been implemented in a Internet of Things (IoT) scenario."

  description: "Metaverse in general holds a potential future for cyberspace. At the beginning of Web 2.0, it was witnessed that people were signing in with various pseudonyms or ‘nyms’, risking their online identities by increasing presence of fake accounts leading to difficulty in unique identification for different roles. However, in Web 3.0, the metaverse, a user's identity is tied to their original identity, where risking one poses a significant risk to the other. Therefore, this research proposes a novel authentication system for securing digital assets, online identity, avatars, and accounts called Metasecure where a unique id for every entity or user to develop a human establishment is essential on a digital platform. The proposed passwordless system provides three layers of security using device attestation, facial recognition and use of physical security keys, security keys, or smartcards in accordance to Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) specifications. It provides SDKs for authentication on any system including VR/XR glasses, thus ensuring seamlessness in accessing services in the Metaverse."

  description: "Cyber resilience strategy is crucial for business continuity since it strengthens an organization's safety profile and reduces the potential danger of key infrastructure exposure. Consequently, it is an active study area that offers a novel approach to Cyber Security. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks, it is essential to have a robust cyber security infrastructure that can detect, prevent, and respond to potential threats. However, a sparsity of case studies speaks to the adoption or measurement of these novel approaches within a complex corporate environment. Defense in depth could be employed to offer an envisaged and layered security strategy, enhancing an organization's overall security. We put forward a security platform that offers endpoint and cloud workloads with coherent XDR (eXtended Detection and Response) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) protection. Our research explores the use of the SIEM tool Wazuh by incorporating extra layers of security via tools such as Network Analyzer and File Auditor. This, in turn, contributes to defense in depth by presenting an integrated picture of security-related events, enhancing threat detection capabilities, leveraging threat intelligence, assisting with compliance initiatives, and facilitating real-time alerting and surveillance.

  description: "In recent years, security preservation has drawn increasing attention due to the Internet's indisputable influence on many facets of human existence. The majority of web users possess logging profiles on websites, and while most websites require only human users to sign up, some automated computer programmes have been known to enter these websites and supply fraudulent registration information to access the resources of these websites. The initial purpose of CAPTCHAs, which was to defend web services from DoS attacks, has been abandoned in favor of pursuing humanrobot differentiation. Hence we present a Proof-of-Work-based rate limiter CAPTCHA, mCaptcha, with variable difficulty that provides reliable security and accessibility. Extensive security and usability assessments are carried out to assess the effectiveness of mCaptcha. We also make the mCaptcha system's source code, and assessment of usability interfaces available to the public in order to aid CAPTCHA security research."

  description: The generation of novel high-bitrate videos from textual prompt is one of the most challenging tasks in the current times. Adding to the complexity, the task of changing character faces in generated videos while maintaining consistent quality and data integrity is complicated. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a solution that produces high-resolution videos and allows swapping of character faces using IMG2IMG diffusion. We propose a Diffusion Pair Upscale Temporal Transformer integrated within a U-Net backbone in the Stable Diffusion-XL model to generate high-quality videos. This architecture is capable of swapping character faces as instructed. The experimental results shown in this paper prove to be a massive potential for filmmakers and especially the production industry, offering a path to visualize their scripts like never before.
